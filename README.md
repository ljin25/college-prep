Future computer science student introducing himself to Github


Problems:

1. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n. Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17.

2. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n.

3. Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12. 

4. Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.

5. Write a program that prints all prime numbers up to 2,000,000,000 (Note: if your programming language does not support arbitrary size numbers, printing all primes up to the largest number you can easily represent is fine too.)
